Check the Lennard Jones repulsion for all three aims. Reduce radius where repulsion kicks in, and increase the power to make repulsion steeper.
For Aim 2, the angle of the ghost swimmer is incorrect. Currently, it's set as 0, but it should be negative of the angle of the original swimmer.
For Aim 2, remove the fixed_time variable. ghost swimmers should be at the same phase as the original swimmer. Hence, ghost.time = p.time.
